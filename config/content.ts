  narrative: [
    `Back in 2023, after living through humid summers in Hyderabad and dusty winters in Delhi, our founders spent thousands on imported serums that broke out their skin. Worse still, when skin flared up, standard e-commerce took 3 to 5 days to deliver a simple calming gel.`,
    `We asked a simple question: If we can get hot food and groceries in 10 minutes, why are we buying cosmetics made 8 months ago that sit in warehouses for weeks?`,
    `That is when ${BRAND_NAME} was born. We built a network of fresh, small-batch formulations tailored specifically for Indian skin tones and humid weather. Paired with our 30-second camera scan, you get hyper-personalized skin routine recommendations.`,
